TODO:
=====
* The salary rule 'Togo - Benefit' takes contract.benefits_in_kind whereas it should take contract.benefits.
    Probably better to rename 'Benefits' into 'Bonus', create a new rule with contract.bonus and change the name of the existing 'Togo - Benefits' into ' Togo - Benefits in kind'.
* Maybe add employee pension allowance rule, so it shows up on the payslip as well? And what's with the other pension allowance?
* Employer's contribution on payslip
* Figure out how to generate/print all payslips at once => cron job
* People automatically raise to the next echelon after 2 years, and their pay automatically follows. Cron job. First do echelon, then seniority!
* Seniority: it's 2% after 2 years, 1% for each subsequent year. But the percentages are calculated according to the wage at the time they "entered" that year.
    => cron job that checks on a daily basis if years of service > stored years of service; adds 1 to years of service if so, adapts stored seniority pay. First do echelon, then seniority!

DONE:
=====
* Calculate base wage based on category, class, echelon (see spreadsheet)
* Payslips & report: monthly/yearly (payslips: use filter, show all, select all, then print; report: choose start/end dates)
* Fix paybook report so it downloads the excell; I already know it works because I wrote it to /tmp and the report looks good.
* Round salary to lower 1000
* Fix Python code in salary rules to deal with OpenERP's insane convention of storing 0 as None in the DB
* remove 'Other deductions' from contract (already used on employee)
* Add 'Pension allowance' ('Indemnité de départ à la retraite' in fr) on employee after 'Other deductions'
* Include 75% of 'Pension allowance' in computation of GROSS
* French translations
* French translations: salary rules in xml, new fields (Pension allowance on Employee)

N/A:
====
* Create export fieldset for employees containing id, name, loan repayment, advance salary, other deductions, overtime (all in monetary terms, no hours for overtime since the formula is complex and not user-friendly to capture through the screens)  ==> Short manual action, no need to figure out how to export that into a data file.
